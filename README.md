Nanopb - protocol buffers with small code size - http://koti.kapsi.fi/jpa/nanopb/

[Nanopb](http://koti.kapsi.fi/jpa/nanopb/) is an ANSI-C library for encoding and decoding messages in Google's [Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/) format with minimal requirements for RAM and code space. It is primarily suitable for 32-bit microcontrollers.

Notes and Differences from C version
------------------------------------

* Currently, you MUST link with a version of Nanopb that was either NOT compiled by GCC, or if it was compiled with GCC, then with either `__GNUC__` undefined or `__attribute__((packed))` disabled. Otherwise, the C side will use packed structs while the D side uses non-packed structs, and things will not work correctly.

* In the C version, `PB_MAX_REQUIRED_FIELDS` can be overridden from either the command line, or by changing it directly in the C header. D does not support setting values from the command line, so it can ONLY be changed by directly modifying the D import module.

* Remember that D's enum values require using the enum's type name. So if, for example, your C code used `PB_LTYPE_VARINT`, then in D you must say `pb_type_t.PB_LTYPE_VARINT`.

* Remember that any callbacks you provide to Nanopb must be `extern(C)`.

* The headers you generate with Nanopb's generator tool still must be translated into D import modules. This Deimos project cannot provide them for you because they are specific to YOUR protobuf messages. Only bindings for the common Nanopb headers (`pb.h`, `pb_encode.h` and `pb_decode.h`) are, and can be, provided.

* The macros `UNUSED` and `STATIC_ASSERT` are not included as they are not needed in D.

* The macros `pb_arraysize`, `pb_delta`, `pb_delta_end`, and `PB_LAST_FIELD` are not currently included. But that should be ok since they appear to only be intended for use by the non-header C code generated by Nanopb's generator tool.

* The macro `PB_RETURN_ERROR` was changed to a CTFE function which returns a string to be mixed-in.

* Note that if you compile the C side with [DMC](http://digitalmars.com), you'll need to change line #193 in `pb.h` like this:

```
From:
#define pb_membersize(st, m) (sizeof ((st*)0)->m)
To:
#define pb_membersize(st, m) (sizeof (((st*)0)->m))
```
